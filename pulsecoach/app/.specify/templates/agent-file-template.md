# Agent Context: [Project Name]

<!-- SPECKIT INSTRUCTIONS:
     This template is used to auto-generate .github/copilot-instructions.md.
     The speckit.agent-context agent populates sections by scanning all
     plan.md files and the current project state.
     Sections marked AUTO-GENERATED are rebuilt on every run.
     Content between MANUAL ADDITIONS markers is preserved across runs.
     Remove instructional HTML comments from the final output.
-->

> **Auto-generated:** YYYY-MM-DD
> Do not edit auto-generated sections directly — they are overwritten
> by the speckit agent. Add manual content between the marked sections.

## Code Style

<!-- AUTO-GENERATED: Language-specific conventions derived from
     linter configs and existing code patterns. -->

### TypeScript

- Strict mode enabled (`strict: true` in tsconfig)
- Prefer `type` over `interface` for object shapes
- Use path aliases: `~/` maps to `src/`
- Named exports only — no default exports
- Explicit return types on public functions

### React / Next.js

- Server Components by default; add `"use client"` only when needed
- Colocate components in `_components/` next to their route
- Use tRPC hooks for data fetching (`api.[router].[procedure].useQuery()`)

### Testing

- Test files: `*.test.ts` in `__tests__/` directories
- Describe blocks mirror module structure
- Use `vi.mock()` for external dependencies
- Aim for behaviour-driven tests, not implementation tests
