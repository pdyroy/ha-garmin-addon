## Installation

### One-Click Install

Click the button at the top of this README, or:

[![Add Repository](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/supervisor_add_addon_repository.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/supervisor_add_addon_repository/?repository_url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Faskb%2Fha-garmin-fitness-coach-addon)

Then install **GarminCoach** from the add-on store and start it.

### Manual Install

1. In Home Assistant go to **Settings → Add-ons → Add-on Store → ⋮ →
   Repositories**.
2. Paste the repository URL:
   ```
   https://github.com/askb/ha-garmin-fitness-coach-addon
   ```
3. Click **Add**, then find **GarminCoach** in the store and click **Install**.
4. Wait for the build to complete (~10-15 minutes on aarch64, ~5 min on amd64).
5. Start the addon — it appears in your sidebar automatically.

### First-Time Setup

1. **Open the addon** from your HA sidebar (or Settings → Add-ons → GarminCoach → Open Web UI).
2. **Complete the onboarding wizard** (4 steps):
   - **About You** — age, sex, weight, height
   - **Your Sports** — select sports and goals for each
   - **Weekly Schedule** — training days and session duration
   - **Health & Safety** *(optional)* — health conditions, injuries, medications
3. **Connect Garmin** — go to **Settings → Connect Garmin**, enter your email
   and password. If MFA is enabled, enter the verification code when prompted.
4. **Wait for initial sync** — the first sync pulls your full Garmin history
   (up to 6+ years). This takes **30-45 minutes** due to Garmin API rate
   limits. You can monitor progress in Settings (a progress bar shows sync
   status). Subsequent syncs only pull the last 7 days and take ~30 seconds.
5. **Restart the addon** after the first sync completes to trigger the
   metrics compute and HA sensor push.

> **⚠️ Initial Sync Note:** The first sync fetches all your historical Garmin
> data (daily stats, activities, HR zones) going back to 2019. This is a
> one-time operation that can take 30-45 minutes due to Garmin Connect API
> rate limits (7 days per batch request). The addon will show sync progress
> in Settings. After the initial sync, daily syncs run every 60 minutes
> (configurable) and complete in under a minute.

> **💡 Tip:** You can trigger a manual sync at any time from
> **Settings → 🔄 Sync Now** without waiting for the next scheduled interval.

## Configuration

| Option | Type | Default | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `garmin_email` | email | — | No | Your Garmin Connect email (or use web-based login in Settings) |
| `garmin_password` | password | — | No | Your Garmin Connect password (or use web-based login in Settings) |
| `ai_backend` | list | `ha_conversation` | No | AI coaching backend (`ha_conversation`, `ollama`, or `none`) |
| `openclaw_agent_id` | string | — | No | OpenClaw agent ID for HA Conversation API (auto-detected if not set) |
| `ollama_url` | url | — | No | Ollama server URL (only when `ai_backend` is `ollama`) |
| `sync_interval_minutes` | integer | `60` | No | How often to pull new data from Garmin (5 – 1440 minutes) |

## Garmin Authentication

GarminCoach authenticates with Garmin Connect using a **web-based auth flow**:

1. Open the addon **Web UI** (sidebar → GarminCoach).
2. Navigate to **Settings → Connect Garmin**.
3. Enter your **email** and **password**. If your account has MFA enabled you
   will be prompted for the one-time code during the same flow.
4. On success the addon stores an OAuth session token locally in
   `/data/garmin-tokens/`. No credentials are sent to any third-party service.

> **Token lifetime:** The session token is valid for roughly **one year**
> before Garmin forces a re-authentication.  The addon will surface a
> notification when a token refresh is needed.

## AI Backend Options

| Backend | Description |
|---|---|
| `ha_conversation` **(default)** | Routes prompts through the Home Assistant Conversation API to whatever agent you have configured (e.g., OpenAI, Claude, local LLM). Zero extra setup if you already use one. |
| `ollama` | Direct HTTP connection to a local [Ollama](https://ollama.com/) instance — fully private, runs on your hardware. Set `ollama_url` to the instance address. |
| `none` | Rules-based coaching only — no LLM required. Still provides all data-driven insights, readiness scores, and training-load analytics. |

|-----------|-------------|
| `sensor.garmincoach_ctl` | Chronic Training Load (42-day fitness) |
| `sensor.garmincoach_atl` | Acute Training Load (7-day fatigue) |
| `sensor.garmincoach_form` | Training Stress Balance (TSB = CTL − ATL) |
| `sensor.garmincoach_acwr` | Acute:Chronic Workload Ratio (injury risk) |
| `sensor.garmincoach_injury_risk` | Risk level: Low / Moderate / High / Very High |
| `sensor.garmincoach_body_battery` | Current Garmin Body Battery value |
| `sensor.garmincoach_sleep_debt` | Accumulated sleep debt (hours) |

## Automation Blueprints & Templates

### HA Blueprints (importable)

Five ready-to-import Home Assistant blueprints are included in
`garmincoach/rootfs/app/blueprints/`. Import them via **Settings → Automations
→ Blueprints → Import Blueprint** using the raw GitHub URL:

| Blueprint | Trigger | What It Does |
|-----------|---------|--------------|
| **Low Body Battery Recovery** | Body Battery < threshold | Dims lights, activates recovery scene, sends push notification |
| **Morning Training Briefing** | Configurable time (default 7 AM) | TTS announcement + push with ACWR, form, and workout recommendation |
| **Injury Risk Alert** | Risk level → high or critical | Urgent push notification, optional DND toggle |
| **Training Freshness Reminder** | TSB (form) > threshold | Push notification to train when body is fresh |
| **Weekly Training Summary** | Configurable day/time | Weekly CTL, ATL, TSB, ACWR, risk, body battery summary |

All blueprints use configurable inputs (thresholds, notification targets,
scenes) with sensible defaults for GarminCoach sensor entities.

### Copy-Paste Automations

Seven additional ready-to-paste automations are provided in
[`HA_AUTOMATIONS.md`](garmincoach/HA_AUTOMATIONS.md):

1. **Low Body Battery Recovery Mode** — dim lights, enable DND
2. **Morning Training Briefing** — daily notification with readiness + plan
3. **High Injury Risk Alert** — ACWR > 1.5 warning
4. **Training Reminder (Fresh)** — nudge when TSB is positive
5. **Sleep Debt Management** — bedtime reminder when debt accumulates
6. **Weekly Summary** — end-of-week training recap
7. **Voice — ACWR Query** — ask your voice assistant about injury risk

## Testing

- **28 passing pytest tests** (+ 59 pre-existing errors in legacy sync tests)
  covering:
  - Garmin auth flow, token handling, daily stats sync, activity sync
  - TRIMP calculation, ingress proxy path rewriting
  - AI workout recommendation logic (rest triggers, optimal signals)
  - Injury risk computation (ACWR, TSB, ramp rate thresholds)
  - EWMA decay constant validation (7-day ATL, 42-day CTL)
  - Confidence degradation with missing/extreme data
  - Scientific reference accuracy (VO2max, Cooper, Riegel)
- **CI:** GitHub Actions builds the Docker image and runs `pytest -v` on every
  PR

## Known Issues

| Issue | Details |
|---|---|
| **First sync is slow** | The initial sync pulls up to 6+ years of Garmin history (daily stats, activities, HR zones). This takes **30-45 minutes** due to API rate limits. Use the 🔄 Sync Now button in Settings to monitor progress. Subsequent syncs take ~30 seconds. |
| **Garmin MFA prompt** | If MFA is enabled on your Garmin account the addon will request the code during the web-based Settings flow. Enter the code promptly — Garmin's MFA session expires quickly. Re-authenticate from Settings if the MFA step times out. |
| **Token expiry (~1 year)** | Garmin session tokens expire after approximately one year. The addon will show an alert; re-authenticate from **Settings → Connect Garmin**. |
| **Rate limiting** | Garmin may temporarily block requests if the sync interval is too aggressive. Keep `sync_interval_minutes` at 30 or above. |
| **Rebuild vs reinstall** | If changes aren't appearing after a rebuild, do a full **uninstall → install**. Docker may cache stale layers during rebuild. |

## Data Persistence & Backup

All data is stored in PostgreSQL at `/data/postgresql/` and automatically
backed up to `/share/garmincoach/` (survives addon uninstalls).

### What Gets Saved

| Data | Location | Backup Path |
|---|---|---|
| Daily metrics, activities, VO2max | PostgreSQL `/data/` | `/share/garmincoach/garmincoach.sql.gz` |
| Athlete Profile & Health info | PostgreSQL `/data/` (profile table) | `/share/garmincoach/garmincoach.sql.gz` |
| Readiness scores, chat history | PostgreSQL `/data/` | `/share/garmincoach/garmincoach.sql.gz` |
| Garmin OAuth tokens | `/data/garmin-tokens/` | `/share/garmincoach/garmin-tokens/` |

### When Backups Happen

- **After every Garmin sync** (hourly by default)
- **On addon shutdown** (graceful stop or HA restart)

### Restore on Reinstall

When the addon starts with an empty database:
1. Checks `/share/garmincoach/garmincoach.sql.gz` — restores full DB if found
2. Checks `/share/garmincoach/garmin-tokens/` — restores auth tokens if found

No manual steps needed — data is restored automatically.

### Athlete Profile vs Garmin Data

| Field | Source | User-Editable? |
|---|---|---|
| Age, sex, weight, height | User input (Settings page) | ✅ Yes |
| Goals, weekly schedule | User input (Settings page) | ✅ Yes |
| Health conditions, injuries, meds | User input (Health & Safety) | ✅ Yes |
| Resting HR, HRV baselines | Computed from Garmin data | ❌ Auto-calculated |
| VO2max, lactate threshold | Synced from Garmin API | ❌ Auto-synced |

## Accuracy — How We Compare to Garmin & WHOOP

Every metric uses **published, peer-reviewed formulas** verified by automated
accuracy tests. Stress and HRV are read directly from your Garmin watch —
identical to what Garmin Connect shows.

### Strain vs Stress — Two Different Metrics

| Metric | What It Measures | Scale | Source |
|--------|-----------------|-------|--------|
| **Strain** | Per-workout cardiovascular load | 0–21 | TRIMP (Banister 1991) |
| **Stress** | All-day HRV-based body stress | 0–100 | Garmin watch (direct API read) |

### Comparison Table

| Chart | Our Method | Garmin Shows | WHOOP Shows | Accuracy |
|-------|-----------|--------------|-------------|----------|
| **Body Stress** | Direct Garmin API (`avgStressLevel`) | Stress Widget (0–100) | N/A | **Identical** to Garmin |
| **HRV Trend** | Direct Garmin API | HRV Status | HRV (RMSSD) | **Identical** to Garmin |
| **Training Strain** | TRIMP → `21×(1-e^(-TRIMP/250))` | Training Effect (Firstbeat) | Day Strain (0–21) | ±1–2 pts vs WHOOP |
| **ACWR** | 7d avg / 28d avg strain | N/A | N/A | Hulin et al. (2016) standard formula |
| **VO2max** | Uth formula: `15.3 × (maxHR/restHR)` | Firstbeat VO2max | N/A | ±3–5 mL/kg/min vs lab |
| **Race Predictions** | Riegel: `T₂ = T₁ × (D₂/D₁)^1.06` | Race Predictor | N/A | ±2–5% for trained runners |
| **Readiness** | Weighted z-scores (HRV 35%, sleep 25%, load 20%, RHR 10%, stress 10%) | Morning Report / Body Battery | Recovery Score | Trend matches; values differ (open formula vs proprietary ML) |
| **Recovery Time** | Strain × base hours, adjusted for sleep/HRV/RHR | Recovery Advisor (Firstbeat) | Recovery hours | ±4–8h (simpler model) |
| **Sleep Score** | Duration 40%, efficiency 25%, deep 20%, REM 15% | Sleep Score | Sleep Performance | Similar components, different weights |

### Key Takeaways

- **Stress & HRV** — exact same numbers as your Garmin watch
- **Strain** — same 0–21 scale and HR-zone basis as WHOOP; ±1–2 points
- **VO2max & Readiness** — open formulas vs Garmin/WHOOP proprietary ML;
  **trends match** but absolute numbers may differ by 5–10%
- **Every formula is open-source and reproducible** — no black box
